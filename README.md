# Turtle-Race Project
The Turtle Race project is a fun and interactive Python program that simulates a race between colorful turtles. Users can place bets on which turtle they think will win the race, adding an element of excitement to the game.


## How It Works
* The program initializes a graphical window using Python's Turtle module, setting up the race track with a width of 500 pixels and a height of 400 pixels.
* Users are prompted to enter their bet on which turtle will win the race, selecting a color from a predefined list.
* Six turtles of different colors are created and positioned at the starting line on the left side of the screen.
* Once the user has placed their bet, the race begins.
* Each turtle moves forward randomly between 0 and 10 units in each iteration of the race loop.
* The race continues until one of the turtles reaches the finish line on the right side of the screen.
* Upon completion of the race, the program determines the winning turtle's color and compares it to the user's bet.
* The user is then notified whether they won or lost the bet.
  
## Features
* Customizable bet options with a choice of six turtle colors.
* Interactive race simulation with visual feedback.
* Dynamic race track with random turtle movements for added unpredictability.
